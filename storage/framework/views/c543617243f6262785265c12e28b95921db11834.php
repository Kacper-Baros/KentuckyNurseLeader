            <p align="center"><strong>It&rsquo;s Time to Recognize those who have Excelled!!!</strong></p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s time to recognize those who you would consider exceptional nurse   leaders; both those who are emerging nurse leaders and those who have   exhibited a lifetime of achievement as a nurse leader.  You will find   attached two forms for each respective nominee:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em><a href="pdf/KONLLifetimeAchievementBluegrassNomineeForm2016.pdf" target="_blank">KONL Lifetime Achievement</a></em></li>
                <li><em><a href="pdf/EmergingNurseLeaderBluegrassNomineeForm.pdf" target="_blank">KONL District Emerging Nurse Leader</a></em></li>
            </ul>
                <p>Criteria for each award is outlined in the forms.  Please review the criteria carefully before submitting a nominee!</p>
                <p>Each district will submit one KONL Lifetime Achievement award to the   KONL, and out of the four districts, one will be chosen as the recipient   for the KONL Lifetime Achievement award. Only one individual is given   this award each year (starting this year) and they will be recognized at   the Fall Leadership Conference. Each district will also submit one   individual as the Emerging Nurse Leader and each district will have this   individual recognized at the annual Fall Leadership Conference (so   there will be four individuals recognized at the Fall Leadership   Conference, one from each district). If you have an individual that you   have admired and would like to submit for either category, please   complete the respective nominee form (attached) and submit the form to: <a href="mailto:mcarr@alliantmanagement.com">mcarr@alliantmanagement.com</a>. <strong>These forms must be in no later than August 1, 2016 in order to be considered</strong>.   The Ohio Valley District committee that will review the nominee   submissions for recognition consists of the following KONL Ohio Valley   District members (if there is anyone else who like to volunteer for this   committee, please let me know at – <a href="mailto:mcarr@alliantmanagement.com">mcarr@alliantmanagement.com</a> ):</p>
