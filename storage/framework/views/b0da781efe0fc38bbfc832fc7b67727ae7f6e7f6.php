            <p>Thanks so much for hosting our District  Meeting today!  We are always happy to  visit different facilities and meet new people.</p>
            <p>I would love to see each of you join  KONL if you are not a member   already.  We  need your voices in decisions made for health care in   Kentucky. See website

            <p>May 19th KONL met at the KHA  Annual Meeting in Lexington.  There   were  some fantastic presenters so I hope most of you were able to   attend. At our  KONL meeting we heard from our poster contest winners   and we heard the results  of our membership survey. </p>
            <p>We are still looking for members who  wish to become more involved in   nursing decision making by becoming a KONL  board member.  If   interested in any of  these positions:  President Elect,  Secretary,   District Director of Bluegrass, and District Director of Ohio  Valley,   please contact Sally Davenport, Nominations Chair at

            <p>KONL is pleased to announce awarding 4  scholarships to nurses   working on their BSN, MSN, PhD, DNP degrees.  They were Aimee Wentz,   Kasey Hartlage, Regina  Masters, and Ruthie Hofner. Congratulations!</p>
            <p>We need nominations for the emerging  nurse leader from each district   and one overall Nurse Excellence nominee from  anywhere in the state.    Please see the  website for the nomination forms and submit them to your   district director.</p>
            <p>Meeting coming up soon for all membership.
